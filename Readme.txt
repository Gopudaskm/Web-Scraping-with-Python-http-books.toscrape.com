The program uses the Python requests library to send HTTP requests to the website and get the HTML content of the web pages. Then, the program uses beautifulsoup and lxml libraries 
to parse the HTML content and extract the desired data.Finally, the program saves the extracted data into a JSON file using the Python json module.

and save the extracted data into a JSON file called 'Books.json' in the same directory as the script.


The program will create a JSON file named Books.json in the same directory as the script. The file will contain a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a book on the website and contains the following fields:
